# Linear Regression Cloud Pine Script

###### TradingView Pine script to compare fast vs slow linear regression lines measured in days.

[TradingView Indicator](https://www.tradingview.com/script/1fPH8BBT-Bitfinex-Longs-vs-Shorts-R1984/)

This indicator compares fast and slow linear regression lines. The fast line crossing above the slow line is bullish.  The fast line crossing below the slow line is bearish.  The lines and the space between them act as resistance and support relative to the price movement against them.

30 days as the fast line and 60 days as the slow line appear to work well for BTC/USD.  Check out multiples of that too: 15/30, 45/90, and 60/120.
